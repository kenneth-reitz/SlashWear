# SlashWear

My first user-facing software, compiles with Borland Turbo C++, in 6th grade.

It features:

- A glorious splash screen.
- A pc-speaker theme song.
- A colored DOS shell with customizable prompt.
- A glimpse into the matrix.
- Lots of easter eggs.

Let the colors wash over you.

*SplashDemo* is the highlight of the package, followed closely by *SplashSong* (make sure to have sound enabled!).

The [original website](http://webpages.charter.net/reitzk/SplashWear.html) that hosted this software is still online. 

## SplashWear 2.0

Thanks to the fine folks over at the Internet Archive, you can now run SplashWear [directly in your web browser](https://archive.org/details/splashwear).
